# 🌳 Prim's Algorithm Visualization – MST Interactive Web App

This project was developed as part of the **"Algorithms and Programming II"** semester course at the Department of Software Engineering, Fırat University.  
The goal is to visualize and analyze **Prim's Algorithm** using Python and Streamlit, enabling users to interactively experience how it works.

## 🛠️ ABOUT THE APPLICATION UPDATE

The second feature under the **"Visualized Graph"** section, titled **"Step-by-Step Display"**, has recently been introduced as part of the application’s latest update.

This module is currently under active development, with the goal of enhancing user interaction and deepening the understanding of Prim’s Algorithm through incremental visual feedback.

🔄 The feature is expected to reach full functionality by **July 13, 2025**.

We appreciate your patience and understanding during this ongoing improvement process.
